<MDXIntro>
  Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
  handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Git object types

- `Blob` - A Git blob (binary large object) is the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository. The file's SHA-1 hash is computed and stored in the blob object.
- `Commit` - A Git commit is a snapshot of the hierarchy (Git tree) and the contents of the files (Git blob) in a Git repository.
- `Tag` - A Git tag is similar to a Git reference, but the Git commit that it points to never changes. Git tags are helpful when you want to point to specific releases.
- `Tree` - A Git tree object creates the hierarchy between files in a Git repository. You can use the Git tree object to create the relationship between directories and the files they contain.

### File states

- `Committed` - The file has been safely stored in a local database.
- `Modified` - The file has been changed but will not go into your next commit.
- `Staged` - The file has been marked in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- `Tracked` - The file has been in the last snapshot. Now, it can be in one of the following possible sub states: `Modified`, `Unmodified`, `Staged` or `Committed`.
- `Unmodified` - The file has not been modified since last commit.
- `Untracked` - Git doesn't track the file.

### Command `config`

**Description**

Get and set repository or global options.

**Options**

- `--global` - Write to global `~/.gitconfig` file rather than the repository `.git/config`.
- `--list, -l` - List all variables set in config file, along with their values.
- `--local` - Write to the repository `.git/config` file. This is the default behavior.
- `--system` - Write to system-wide `$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig` rather than the repository `.git/config`.

**Examples**

- `git config --global alias.amend commit --amend` - Set an alias for a frequently used git commands.
- `git config --global core.editor "nano -w"` - Set nano editor as the default.
- `git config --global core.editor "vim"` - Set vim editor as the default.
- `git config --global user.email "ofadiman@gmail.com"` - Set global email.
- `git config --global user.name "ofadiman"` - Set global username.

### Command `add`

**Description**

Add file contents to the index.

**Options**

- `--chmod=(+|-)x` - Override the executable bit of the added files. The executable bit is only changed in the index, the files on disk are left unchanged.
- `--dry-run, -n` - Don’t actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.
- `--force, -f` - Allow adding otherwise ignored files.
- `--interactive, -i` - Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to the index.

**Examples**

- `git add .` - Add everything to the staging area.
- `git add docs/\*.txt` - Add all files with `.txt` extension in `docs` directory to the staging area.

### Command `commit`

**Description**

Record changes to the repository.

**Options**

- `--amend` - Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit.
- `--author=<author>` - Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard `author <author@example.com>` format.
- `--dry-run` - Do not create a commit, but show a list of paths that are to be committed, paths with local changes that will be left uncommitted and paths that are untracked.
- `--long` - When doing a dry-run, give the output in the long-format. Implies `--dry-run`.
- `--message=<msg>, -m <msg>` - Use the given `<msg>` as the commit message. If multiple `-m` options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.
- `--no-verify, -n` - This option bypasses the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.
- `--patch, -p` - Use the interactive patch selection interface to chose which changes to commit.
- `--porcelain` - When doing a dry-run, give the output in a porcelain-ready format. Implies `--dry-run`.

**Examples**

- `git commit --amend -m "fix: component state"` - Amend the last commit with a new message.
- `git commit --author="Ofadiman <ofadiman@gmail.com>" -m "fix: components"` - Override the commit author.

### Command `branch`

**Description**

List, create, or delete branches.

**Options**

- `--delete, -d` -
- `-D` - Shortcut for `--delete --force`.

**Examples**

### Command `merge`

**Description**

**Options**

**Examples**

### Command `rebase`

**Description**

**Options**

**Examples**

### Command `checkout`

**Description**

**Options**

### Command `clone`

**Description**

Clone a repository into a new directory.

**Options**

- `--branch <name>, -b <name>` - Instead of pointing the newly created **HEAD** to the branch pointed to by the cloned repository’s **HEAD**, point to `<name>` branch instead.

**Examples**

- `git clone -b feat/component git@github.com:Ofadiman/repo.git` - Clone only `feat/component` branch from a remote repo.

### Command `rm`

**Description**

Remove files from the working tree and from the index.

**Options**

- `--dry-run, -n` - Don’t actually remove any file(s). Instead, just show if they exist in the index and would otherwise be removed by the command.
- `-r` - Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.
- `--` - This option can be used to separate command-line options from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for command-line options).

**Examples**

- `git rm --cached opinion.txt` - Remove specified file from staging area (works when the file hasn't been committed yet).

### Command `reset`

**Description**

**Options**

**Examples**
