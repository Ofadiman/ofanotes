## `Partial`

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.

```typescript
type Partial<Type> = { [Key in keyof Type]?: Type[Key] }
```

## `Readonly`

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to readonly, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

```typescript
type Readonly<Type> = { readonly [Key in keyof Type]: Type[Key] }
```

## `Record`

Constructs a type with a set of properties `Keys` of type `Type`. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type.

```typescript
type Record<Key extends keyof any, Type> = { [P in Key]: Type }
```
