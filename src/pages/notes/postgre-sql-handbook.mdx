### General info

- In conditions, You must put strings in single quotes.
- If a string has single quote inside it, You can escape it by putting additional single quote next to the first one.

---

### Utility commands

- `\! clear` - clear terminal.
- `\c <database-name>` - connect to other database.
- `\dn` - list all schemas.
- `\dt` - list all data types.
- `\l` - list all databases.
- `docker-compose exec <service-name> psql <username> <password>` - connect to database running inside docker container.

### Keywords

- `AND` - The PostgreSQL `AND` condition (also called the `AND` Operator) is used to test two or more conditions in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, UPDATE, or `DELETE` statement.
- `BETWEEN` - The PostgreSQL `BETWEEN` condition is used to retrieve values within a range in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
- `DISTINCT` - The PostgreSQL `DISTINCT` clause is used to remove duplicates from the result set. The `DISTINCT` clause can only be used with `SELECT` statements.
- `HAVING` - The PostgreSQL `HAVING` clause is used in combination with the `GROUP BY` clause to restrict the groups of returned rows to only those whose the condition is `TRUE`.
- `INTERSECT` - The PostgreSQL `INTERSECT` operator returns the intersection of 2 or more datasets.
- `IN` - The PostgreSQL `IN` condition is used to help reduce the need to use multiple `OR` conditions in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
- `NOT` - The PostgreSQL `NOT` condition (also called the `NOT` operator) is used to negate a condition in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
- `ORDER BY` - The PostgreSQL `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the records in your result set. The `ORDER BY` clause can only be used in `SELECT` statements.
- `OR` - The PostgreSQL `OR` condition is used to test two or more conditions where records are returned when any one of the conditions are met. It can be used in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
- `SELECT` - The PostgreSQL `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables.
- `UNION` - The PostgreSQL `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more `SELECT` statements. It removes duplicate rows between the various `SELECT` statements.
- `USING` - The PostgreSQL `USING` clause is a shorthand that allows you to take advantage of the specific situation where both sides of the join use the same name for the joining column(s).
- `WHERE` - The PostgreSQL `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results from a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

### Selecting data from a table

- `SELECT` - The PostgreSQL `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables in PostgreSQL.

```sql
SELECT name, address FROM users;
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customers;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM categories;
SELECT COUNT(username) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM suppliers;

SELECT order_id, shipped_date - order_date FROM orders;
SELECT order_id, unit_price * quantity FROM order_details;

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'Mexico';
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title = 'can''t cook'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_details WHERE quantity > 20;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE price <= 250;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '1998-01-01';

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE price > 100 AND ship_country = 'Germany';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ship_country = 'USA' OR shipcountry = 'Brazil';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE (ship_country = 'Canada' OR ship_country = 'Spain') AND shipped_date > '1997-05-01';

SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
SELECT * FROM order_details WHERE unit_price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'Spain', 'Italy');

SELECT DISTINCT country, city FROM suppliers ORDER BY country ASC, city DESC;
SELECT product_name, unit_price FROM products ORDER BY unit_price DESC, product_name ASC;

SELECT MIN(orde_rdate) FROM orders WHERE ship_country = 'Italy';
SELECT MAX(shipped_date) FROM orders WHERE ship_country = 'Canada';
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM order_details WHERE product_id = 14;
SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM order_details WHERE product_id = 35;

# `%` sign stands for 0 or more any characters.
# `_` sign stands for exactly 1 any charater.
SELECT company_name FROM suppliers WHERE company_name LIKE '_or%';

SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_spent FROM order_details;
SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_spent FROM order_details ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
# This does not work, because `WHERE` runs before `SELECT`
SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_spent FROM order_details WHERE total_spent > 10;

SELECT product_name, uni_tprice * units_in_stock AS total_inventory FROM products ORDER BY total_inventory ASC LIMIT 2;

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE region IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE region IS NOT NULL;
```

### Joining tables

- `INNER JOIN` - The PostgreSQL `INNER JOIN` (simply `JOIN`) returns all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met.

```sql
SELECT customer_name, order_date FROM orders JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
SELECT suppliers_name, product_price FROM products JOIN suppliers ON products.supplier_id = suppliers.supplier_id;

SELECT company_name, order_date, unit_price, quantity FROM orders
JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id=order_details.order_id
JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id;

SELECT company_name, product_name, category_name, order_date, order_details.unit_price, quantity FROM orders
JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
JOIN products ON products.product_id = order_details.product_id
JOIN categories ON categories.category_id = products.category_id
WHERE category_name = 'Seafood' AND order_details.unit_price * quantity >= 500;
```

- `LEFT OUTER JOIN` - The PostgreSQL `LEFT OUTER JOIN` (simply `LEFT JOIN`) returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).

```sql

SELECT product_name, order_id FROM products
LEFT JOIN order_details ON products.product_id = order_details.product_id;

SELECT product_name, order_id FROM products
LEFT JOIN order_details ON products.product_id = order_details.product_id WHERE order_id IS NULL;
```

- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` - The PostgreSQL `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` (simply `RIGHT JOIN`) returns all rows from the RIGHT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).

```sql
SELECT company_name, order_id FROM orders RIGHT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE order_id IS NULL;

SELECT company_name, products.customer_id FROM products
RIGHT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = products.customer_id;
```

- `FULL OUTER JOIN` - The PostgreSQL `FULL OUTER JOIN` (simply `FULL JOIN`) returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table and RIGHT-hand table with nulls in place where the join condition is not met.

```sql
SELECT company_name, order_id FROM orders
FULL JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

SELECT product_name, category_name FROM categories
FULL JOIN products ON products.category_id = categories.category_id;
```

- `USING` - Reducing typings.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
JOIN order_details USING (order_id);


SELECT * FROM orders
JOIN order_details USING (order_id)
JOIN products USING (product_id);
```

### Grouping and aggregation

- `GROUP BY` - The PostgreSQL `GROUP BY` clause is used in a `SELECT` statement to collect data across multiple records and group the results by one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), country FROM customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*), category_name FROM categories
JOIN products ON categories.category_id = products.category_id
GROUP BY category_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT product_name, ROUND(AVG(quantity)) FROM products
JOIN order_details ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY AVG(quantity) DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*),country FROM suppliers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * order_details.unit_price) AS amount_bought FROM products
JOIN order_details ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id
JOIN orders ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY amount_bought DESC;
```

- `HAVING` - The PostgreSQL `HAVING` clause is used in combination with the `GROUP BY` clause to restrict the groups of returned rows to only those whose the condition is `TRUE`.

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * order_details.unit_price) AS amout_bought FROM products
JOIN order_details USING (product_id)
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(quantity * order_details.unit_price) < 2000
ORDER BY amout_bought ASC;

SELECT company_name, SUM(quantity * order_details.unit_price) AS amout_bought FROM customers
NATURAL JOIN orders
NATURAL JOIN order_details
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-6-30'
GROUP BY company_name
HAVING SUM(quantity * order_details.unit_price) > 5000
ORDER BY amout_bought DESC;
```

### Combining queries

- `UNION` - The PostgreSQL `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more `SELECT` statements. It removes duplicate rows between the various `SELECT` statements. Each `SELECT` statement within the `UNION` operator must have the same number of fields in the result sets with similar data types.

```sql
SELECT company_name FROM customers
UNION
SELECT company_name FROM suppliers;
```

- `INTERSECT` - The PostgreSQL `INTERSECT` operator returns the intersection of 2 or more datasets. Each dataset is defined by a `SELECT` statement. If a record exists in both data sets, it will be included in the `INTERSECT` results. However, if a record exists in one data set and not in the other, it will be omitted from the `INTERSECT` results.

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
INTERSECT
SELECT city FROM suppliers
ORDER BY country ASC;
```

- `EXCEPT` - The PostgreSQL `EXCEPT` operator is used to return all rows in the first `SELECT` statement that are not returned by the second SELECT statement. Each `SELECT` statement will define a dataset. The `EXCEPT` operator will retrieve all records from the first dataset and then remove from the results all records from the second dataset.

```sql
SELECT city FROM suppliers
EXCEPT
SELECT city FROM customers;
```

### Modifying data in tables

- `INSERT` - The PostgreSQL `INSERT` statement is used to insert a single record or multiple records into a table in PostgreSQL.

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, employee_id, order_date)
VALUES (1, 4, '2017-09-16')
```

- `UPDATE` - The PostgreSQL `UPDATE` statement is used to update existing records in a table in a PostgreSQL database.

```sql
UPDATE order_details
SET quantity = 40, discount = .05
WHERE order_id = 11078 AND product_id = 11;
```

- `DELETE` - The PostgreSQL `DELETE` statement is used to delete a single record or multiple records from a table in PostgreSQL.

```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_id = 11078;
```

- `SELECT INTO` - The PostgreSQL `SELECT INTO` statement is used to copy all records from one table to another table in PostgreSQL.

```sql
SELECT * INTO orders_1997 FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31';
```

- `INSERT INTO SELECT` - The PostgreSQL `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement is used to copy all or only chosen records from one table to another table in PostgreSQL.

```sql
INSERT INTO orders_1997 SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '1996-12-01' AND '1996-12-31'
```

- `RETURNING` - The PostgreSQL `RETURNING` statement is used to return specific columns after `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements in PostgreSQL.

```sql
UPDATE products SET unit_price = unit_price * 1.2 WHERE product_id = 1
RETURNING product_id, unit_price AS new_price;
```
