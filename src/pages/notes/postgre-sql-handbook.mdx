### General info

- In conditions, You must put strings in single quotes.
- If a string has single quote inside it, You can escape it by putting additional single quote next to the first one.

---

### Keywords

- `AND` - The PostgreSQL AND condition (also called the AND Operator) is used to test two or more conditions in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- `BETWEEN` - The PostgreSQL BETWEEN condition is used to retrieve values within a range in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- `DISTINCT` - The PostgreSQL DISTINCT clause is used to remove duplicates from the result set. The DISTINCT clause can only be used with SELECT statements.
- `IN` - The PostgreSQL IN condition is used to help reduce the need to use multiple OR conditions in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- `NOT` - The PostgreSQL NOT condition (also called the NOT operator) is used to negate a condition in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- `OR` - The PostgreSQL OR condition is used to test two or more conditions where records are returned when any one of the conditions are met. It can be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- `SELECT` - The PostgreSQL SELECT statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables.
- `WHERE` - The PostgreSQL WHERE clause is used to filter the results from a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
