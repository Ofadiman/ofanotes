<MDXIntro>
  Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a type of interpreter that processes shell
  commands. A shell interpreter takes commands in plain text format and calls
  Operating System services to do something. A shell scripting is writing a
  program for the shell to execute and a shell script is a file or program that
  shell will execute.

### General info

- Bash is an interpreter which means that it reads and executes your script line by line.
- Runtime errors do not stop script execution.
- Set the absolute path to the bash interpreter like this `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to make sure your commands will run on every system.
- Type `echo $?` to print the status code of the latest executed command.

### Commands in a nutshell

- `cat` - Concatenate files to standard output.
- `crontab` - Maintain crontab files for individual users.
- `cut` - Print selected parts of lines from each file to standard output.
- `date` - Print or set the system date and time.
- `grep` - Search for patterns in each file.
- `head` - Print the first 10 lines of each file to standard output.
- `less` - Print the file content one page at a time.
- `man` - Print the manual of another command.
- `ping` - Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts.
- `ps` - Report a snapshot of the current processes.
- `pwd` - Print the name of the current working directory.
- `set` - Set or unset values of shell options and positional parameters.
- `ssh` - OpenSSH remote login client.
- `systemctl` - Control the systemd system and service manager.
- `tail` - Print the last 10 lines of each file to standard output.
- `tee` - Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.
- `test` - Check file types and compare values.
- `tr` - Translate, squeeze, and delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.
- `whatis` - Print more information about selected command.
- `which` - Identify the location of a given executable.

### File descriptors

A file descriptor is an integer number that indicates **_STDIN_**, **_STDOUT_**, **_STDERR_**.

- `0` - Indicates **_STDIN_**.
- `1` - Indicates **_STDOUT_**.
- `2` - Indicates **_STDERR_**.

### Redirection operations

- `cat < filename.txt` - Read file content.
- `cat << EOF <some-content-here> EOF` - Specify the delimiter (usually `EOF`). After the program sees the delimiter, it will stop.
- `cat <<< "This is a string"` - Provide a string for a program.
- `ls -a &> output.txt` - This is a shortcut command for storing both success and error results in the same file.
- `ls -a 1> success.txt 2> error.txt` - Specify the files for success and error outputs of selected command.
- `ls -a 2>> filename.txt` - Append error output of `ls -a` command in the specified file.
- `ls -a > filename.txt` - Store success output of `ls -a` command in the specified file (overrides the file).
- `ls -lrt | awk ${print $1}` - Pipe output from one command to input of another command.

### Command `ls`

- `-A` - List all files and directories (hidden inclusive) but hide `.` and `..` from output.
- `-R` - List files and directories with their content recursively.
- `-X` - Sort entries by file extensions.
- `-a` - List all files directories (includes hidden content).
- `-d */` - List only directories.
- `-h` - Format files sizes in a more human-readable way.
- `-l` - Use long format.
- `-r` - Use reversed mode (by default reversed alphabetical order).
- `-t` - Sort by last modified date in descending order.

### Command `grep`

- `-A <number>` - Print X number of lines after match.
- `-B <number>` - Print X number of lines before match.
- `-c` - Print only a count of selected lines per file.
- `-i` - Ignore case distinctions in patterns and data.
- `-n` - Print line number with output lines.
- `-v` - Select non-matching lines.
- `-w` - Match only whole words.

**Examples**

- `cat my_servers_info.txt | grep -E "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"` - List all ip v4 strings in the file.
- `grep "bash" *` - Search for **_bash_** string in the current directory.
- `grep "bash" file1.txt file2.txt` - Search for **_bash_** string in selected files.
- `ls -lart | grep "^-"` - List all files in the current directory.
- `ls -lart | grep "^d"` - List all directories in the current directory.

### Command `awk`

- `-F:` - Change default separator (space) to colon.

**Examples**

- `awk '/^UUID/ {print $0}' /etc/fstab` - Print something with regexp search.
- `awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1,$6}' /etc/passwd` - Print values when the third field is more or equal to a 1000.
- `date | awk 'OFS="/" {print $2, $3, $4}'` - Print selected columns from `date` command output and use `/` as a separator.
- `date | awk '{print $2,$3,$6}'` - Print selected columns from `date` command output.
- `who | awk 'BEGIN {print "Active Sessions"} {print $1,$4}'` - Print something preceded with a string.
- `who | awk 'END {print "Done"} {print $1,$4}'` - Print something followed by a string.

### Command chaining operators

- `&&` - Execute all commands one by one and stop immediately when the first command fails (`ls && docker -v && pwd`).
- `;` - Execute all commands one by one and don't stop when some commands fail (`ls;docker -v;pwd`).
- `||` - Execute second command only if the first failed (`docker -v || ls`).

You can also combine this operators like so: `which docker && echo "docker is installed" || echo "docker is not installed"`.
