### Tips

- Never try to solve problems your way. First, search the internet for solutions to similar problems. When you create a React component, first look at how popular UI libraries such as [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) or [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) implement a similar component. When you want to perform some action on arrays or objects, see if there is already a solution in libraries such as [lodash](https://lodash.com/) or [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/).
- Make a lot of small pull requests rather than a few large ones.
- Review your code first before sending it to code review.
- Understand the business requirements behind your code.
- When the code "works" it's not time for a commit, it's time for refactoring.
- Write a clear changelist description.
